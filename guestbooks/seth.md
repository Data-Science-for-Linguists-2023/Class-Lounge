# Discourse Analysis via Reddit

Hello everyone, welcome to my guestbook!

I chose this product because the development of discourse online is unique, due to its asynchronous and (largely) anonymous nature. Please check out [my repo](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/Analyzing-Discourse-Structure-via-Reddit) for more info!


## Sen's Notes
Seth, I think you have a done a great job coming up with a linguistically-motivated analysis question and I'm looking forward to seeing the conclusion of your project.

Based on your data collection Jupyter notebook, I learned about python libraries such as praw (and coding in general). Your notebook is super clean and the way you take a look at the output at various steps makes it easy to follow and get a clear picture of the data you're working with.

While I'm not very familiar with discourse analysis, something that came to mind as a suggestion was checking out the [Empath tool](https://github.com/Ejhfast/empath-client) for analyzing text across lexical categories. Maybe it can help you make generalizations about the types of lexical features that are prominent in the comments.

## Moldir's Notes

1. Well done: The data collection section was done very well! I am impressed with how you extracted necessary data from multiple subreddits. Your code snippets are easy to follow, and you provide enough notes throughout JNB.

2. What I learned: There is a separate package for extracting data from Reddit. Seems very handy and efficient when dealing with such a nested data structure as yours.

3. Suggestion: Clarifying how you will explore turn-taking in online discourse and what discourse categories will be the main focus of your project: language-in-use or socio-political.
