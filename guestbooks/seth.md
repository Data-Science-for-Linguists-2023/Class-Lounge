## Sen's Notes
Seth, I think you have a done a great job coming up with a linguistically-motivated analysis question and I'm looking forward to seeing the conclusion of your project.

Based on your data collection Jupyter notebook, I learned about python libraries such as praw (and coding in general). Your notebook is super clean and the way you take a look at the output at various steps makes it easy to follow and get a clear picture of the data you're working with.

While I'm not very familiar with discourse analysis, something that came to mind as a suggestion was checking out the [Empath tool](https://github.com/Ejhfast/empath-client) for analyzing text across lexical categories. Maybe it can help you make generalizations about the types of lexical features that are prominent in the comments.
