# Discourse Analysis via Reddit

Hello everyone, welcome to my guestbook!

I chose this product because the development of discourse online is unique, due to its asynchronous and (largely) anonymous nature. Please check out [my repo](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/Analyzing-Discourse-Structure-via-Reddit) for more info!


## Sen's Notes
Seth, I think you have a done a great job coming up with a linguistically-motivated analysis question and I'm looking forward to seeing the conclusion of your project.

Based on your data collection Jupyter notebook, I learned about python libraries such as praw (and coding in general). Your notebook is super clean and the way you take a look at the output at various steps makes it easy to follow and get a clear picture of the data you're working with.

While I'm not very familiar with discourse analysis, something that came to mind as a suggestion was checking out the [Empath tool](https://github.com/Ejhfast/empath-client) for analyzing text across lexical categories. Maybe it can help you make generalizations about the types of lexical features that are prominent in the comments.

-- Seth: Thanks for the feedback, Sen! Using the empath tool seems like a really cool direction I could take my analysis. Don't be surprised if it ends up in there!

## Moldir's Notes

1. Well done: The data collection section was done very well! I am impressed with how you extracted necessary data from multiple subreddits. Your code snippets are easy to follow, and you provide enough notes throughout JNB.

2. What I learned: There is a separate package for extracting data from Reddit. Seems very handy and efficient when dealing with such a nested data structure as yours.

3. Suggestion: Clarifying how you will explore turn-taking in online discourse and what discourse categories will be the main focus of your project: language-in-use or socio-political.  

-- Seth: Thank you, Moldir! I'm glad my code was easy to follow :)

## Camryn's Notes

I think you have done a great job so far!

1. As someone who has also worked with PRAW, I see you have made great progress with setting up and collecting posts from subreddits. I also think you make great comments throughout your notebooks, which is helpful for understanding.

2. I think what you have so far is good, but I think some organization in your repository would help! For example, putting all of your notebooks into a folder. I also think having something in your README about the order in which one should go through your notebooks would also be helpful.

3.  One thing I wasn't super aware of was the concept of turn-taking in online discourse, and how this can be observed and analyzed.

-- Seth: Thank you for your feedback Camryn! Using the README to establish an order to my repository is a great idea, and I'll probably go ahead and do that.

## Mack's Notes

I love the concept and approach for this topic! Looking at a thread through the lens of discourse is really interesting and I look forward to seeing how everything shapes up.

1. You have a great handle on how the data are structured and how you are going to coerce the raw data to make sense for your research.

2. You are working with a lot of data (which you present very clearly) and the notebooks are very text heavy, especially with some of the long outputs that Python generates. So I think some visualization of the data may help give the audience a different view of the data. Some graphs on comments per subreddit or some idea of engagement per subreddit, if one subreddit you've selected is more popular than the others.

3. I had no idea that the Reddit API had built in functionality with Python. This is a great way to streamline the work you have done.

-- Thanks for the feedback, Mack! I agree, my notebook is text-heavy and could use a bit more graphs!

## Ashley's Notes

This is such an interesting topic!

1. What I Liked: I loved the explanations and comments you included throughout your JNB code. I felt I could easily understand your thought process and if I ever didn't understand what a certain line of code did, you almost always had an explanation so I didn't get stuck (especially as someone without a ton of CS experience). Great work!

2. Suggestion: You do a great job leading the reader through your JNBs, but just within your repo, it would be helpful to organize your JNBs a bit more so viewers easily know what to look at in what order. I would recommend adding links in your progress report to the JNBs you worked on in each section so they're easier to find.

3. What I Learned: I never knew or thought about the fact that if an API is open-source, you can adjust the code to make it work best for you! Editing the code to look at comments depth-first instead of breadth-first was a great idea. 


## Varun's Notes

## Varun

- **One thing I like:** I like topic selection. Plus, the list comprehensions!

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** Maybe keeing in mind the print output, it kinda gets long in the notebook.

- **One thing I learned:** The DFS approach for the comments, I've been iterating them on my project.
