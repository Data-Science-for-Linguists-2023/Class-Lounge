## Background Information

This project seeks to analyze morpheme acquisition order. Many 'natural order' studies claim that there is a universal and consistent order in which language learners acquire proficiency in the use of grammatical morphemes. I would like to analyze spoken corpora to determine this sequence and whether it actually aligns with previously proposed studies. Particularly, I would like to see if there is a contrast in the order between L1 or native-speaker production and L2 or language learner production.

## Notes

### Mack's Notes
I like this topic! Your findings will be really interesting especially because of the theoretical background you are comparing them to.

1. You've got a great start with your data and the annotations provided will really help with your analysis.

2. Because you are working with a theoretical background I think giving a brief overview of that may be beneficial.

3. I learned that there is a theory of the order we learn morphemes.

### Moldir's Notes
I like how well-organized and tidy your markdown files are! Your topic is also very intriguing, and I look forward to seeing your final analysis.

1. Well done: I think the data curation part was done very well, and the data samples you collected fully aligned with the project goals.

2. What I learned: There is a Python library for language acquisition research! 

3. Suggestion: I also agree with Mack on adding a brief theoretical overview for those who are not familiar with the morpheme acquisition order studies or the second language acquisition field in general.
