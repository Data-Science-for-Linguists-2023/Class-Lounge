## Mack's Notes
I like this topic! Your findings will be really interesting especially because of the theoretical background you are comparing them to.

1. You've got a great start with your data and the annotations provided will really help with your analysis.

2. Because you are working with a theoretical background I think giving a brief overview of that may be beneficial.

3. I learned that there is a theory of the order we learn morphemes.
