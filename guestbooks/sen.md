## Background Information

This project seeks to analyze morpheme acquisition order. Many 'natural order' studies claim that there is a universal and consistent order in which language learners acquire proficiency in the use of grammatical morphemes. I would like to analyze spoken corpora to determine this sequence and whether it actually aligns with previously proposed studies. Particularly, I would like to see if there is a contrast in the order between L1 or native-speaker production and L2 or language learner production.

## Notes

### Mack's Notes
I like this topic! Your findings will be really interesting especially because of the theoretical background you are comparing them to.

1. You've got a great start with your data and the annotations provided will really help with your analysis.

2. Because you are working with a theoretical background I think giving a brief overview of that may be beneficial.

3. I learned that there is a theory of the order we learn morphemes.

### Moldir's Notes
I like how well-organized and tidy your markdown files are! Your topic is also very intriguing, and I look forward to seeing your final analysis.

1. Well done: I think the data curation part was done very well, and the data samples you collected fully aligned with the project goals.

2. What I learned: There is a Python library for language acquisition research! 

3. Suggestion: I also agree with Mack on adding a brief theoretical overview for those who are not familiar with the morpheme acquisition order studies or the second language acquisition field in general. 

### Camryn's Notes

I think you have made really great progress!

1. I really like how detailed your notebooks are. The comments throughout them are super helpful for understanding what is going, so they are really appreciated! For example, seeing where you ran into issues and how you planned to resolve them.

2. I think your project looks great, but potentially adding more information to your README file could be beneficial. For example, you have some background information in your project plan, but I think this information would be great in your README file!

3. Similar to what Mack mentioned, I also didn't know of the theory mentioned in the project plan. I knew there was a lot of research in the world of language acquisition and second language acquisition, but it is really fascinating that there are different theories on the order in which different language learners learn morphemes.

### Ashley's Notes

1. I love how thorough your explanations are for every step of the process. You have a clear research goal that is well-articulated, and you clearly explained how the different data sets you tried either did or did fit in with that goal, allowing you to switch to data that would be most helpful for you. Great work keeping a clear focus!

2. One suggestion I have is to try to clarify the connection you will be looking at between L1/L2 learners' morpheme acquisition. Will you be comparing the number of years someone has been learning English as a second language to the age of a native English speaker numerically? Or will you just be looking at the order of morpheme acquisition over time in each group independent of one another, then comparing those orders? This is just a small note, but it might be worth clarifying before you begin your analysis. 

3. I'm so interested in this PyLangAcq library! Especially when you were able to use the library to annotate the corpus for each token's part of speech and morpheme, I was amazed at how much using the right tools could help your data processing and analysis - I had no idea something like this existed and will definitely be taking a look at additional Python libraries for my own project.

### Wilson

- **One thing I like:** I think the concept of your analysis is really interesting and it's really easy to understand what exactly your goals are. 

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** It's not a big deal at all (especially since you already wrote the code) but the `get_<feature>` functions could probably be refactored into one function that takes a regex pattern as a parameter. Everything else in the functions is the same, so you have a lot of repeated code.

- **One thing I learned:** I didn't know there was a set idea of a general morpheme acquisition order for language learners -- I would have assumed it varied too much for something like that to really make sense. I guess that's what your analysis is investigating -- whether that set order is really valid.

### Varun

- **One thing I like:** I like the pretty printing. Also the "You are here" markings and the documentation. Very nice.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** I did notice 2 blank PNGs in the folder, but it might just be like that on git or just on my browser.

- **One thing I learned:** I learned about PyLangAcq. Pretty cool!
