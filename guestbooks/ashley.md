- **One thing I like:** You were very thorough with your data processing to make sure you had the data the way you wanted it, which was cool to see.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** One idea for handling those especially large JSON files would be to split some of your code out into its own .py file, which would process the data and output it in a format that the notebook can more easily read (like a pickle.) It might also save a lot of code if you put your processing into a reusable function that could be called on any genre, so you don't have to re-write the same code over and over for every different genre.

- **One thing I learned:** It was funny that there were so many book format values in the dataset -- 209! -- including "three books in boxed set" and "Board Book Periodical". I would have assumed they had a standard set of formats, but maybe there's some way to add a custom format when adding a book?
