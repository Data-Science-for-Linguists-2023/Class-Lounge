- **What I liked:** I found your choice of subreddits incredibly interesting! I had no idea 'lawyertalk' existed, and I imagine these will be fruitful in analyzing language data. I'm interested to see how internet lingo will weigh into grammaticality ratings.

- **An avenue for improvement:** Related to what I liked, it would be great to see more samples of the text you'll be analyzing! Much of it was only visible in previews when the head of a df was displayed. Also, although this isn't really an improvement, maybe pickling your dataframes instead of converting them to csv's will be easier to deal with in the future. This is just based on preference, though

- **What I learned:** I'm also working with Reddit/PRAW, so our tables are nearly identical in structure.Dropping nulls is a wise idea, and I may use your code as reference for handling my own tables!g
