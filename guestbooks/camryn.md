- **What I liked:** I found your choice of subreddits incredibly interesting! I had no idea 'lawyertalk' existed, and I imagine these will be fruitful in analyzing language data. I'm interested to see how internet lingo will weigh into grammaticality ratings.

- **An avenue for improvement:** Related to what I liked, it would be great to see more samples of the text you'll be analyzing! Much of it was only visible in previews when the head of a df was displayed. Also, although this isn't really an improvement, maybe pickling your dataframes instead of converting them to csv's will be easier to deal with in the future. This is just based on preference, though

- **What I learned:** I'm also working with Reddit/PRAW, so our tables are nearly identical in structure.Dropping nulls is a wise idea, and I may use your code as reference for handling my own tables!g

- **Well Done:** Like Seth said, I think the specific subreddits you chose are awesome! The fact that you adapted your plan to go from looking at different geographical subreddits to different content subreddits shows that you have a strong linguistic focus in mind, and I think that change will be really beneficial. Your subreddits cover a wide range of different topics that I'm sure will show some linguistic differences - I particularly love ELIF and bet you'll find plenty of interesting things to explore!  

- **Suggestion:** I am not very familiar with reddit, but if I understand your data correctly it looks like the text is from the same person that wrote the title/made the post. Since some of your reddits seem to be more like forums for posing questions, is there a way to also collect data on different users' responses on the reddit thread? For example, subreddits like ELIF or Legal Advice seem like the most distinct language differences would be from the people responding to the posed question, talking simply like to a 5-year old or more sophisticated like a lawyer. I know you already have a lot of great data, but this could be something to explore!

- **What I Learned:** I learned a lot about what data scraping can look like when a website has an API designed specifically for it (I was going to use Goodreads' API for my project, but they discontinued it :( so I haven't been able to explore as much as I'd hoped). Your project gave me some great insight into what that process looks like and how to work efficiently with an API.
