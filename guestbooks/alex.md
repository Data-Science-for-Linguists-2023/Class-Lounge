## [Analyzing Blame Shifting on AITA](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/AITA-Blame-Analysis)

- **One thing I like:** I think your idea is really interesting, and it'll be cool to see what the end result is! It sucks though that you're running into so many issues simply collecting your data, but at least there seems to be some workarounds.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** It seems like the data you're getting has their flair set to "None", which is a bit odd and seems like it'd get in the way of your analysis, since you're relying on the flair data in order to categorize each post. Some mention of this would probably have been good, because as of now, it seems like the data you currently have might not be usable for your purposes.

- **One thing I learned:** I had heard of the Pushshift API, but I didn't know there was a package for it, so that was cool to learn. It's too bad that it's in such a buggy state, though.

#### one thing i think is done well
i love the project idea, i read it and i went "dang that's good"

#### one suggestion
maybe consider the role comments have to play? not just the up/down numbers but what they're saying? not sure if you are using that already for validation

#### one thing i learned
i didn't know the PMAW existed, definitely good to know since i am working with reddit data!

- **One thing I liked:**
    I liked how in detail you explained your steps. It was very easy to follow your process of thoughts.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:**
    I believe you can uppercase the column names using .upper() method with for list comprehension. This was the only quibble I had.

- **One thing I learned:**
    I also did not know that there is a package for Reddit scraping! So cool to learn.
