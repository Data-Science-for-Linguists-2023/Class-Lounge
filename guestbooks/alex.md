- **One thing I like:** I think your idea is really interesting, and it'll be cool to see what the end result is! It sucks though that you're running into so many issues simply collecting your data, but at least there seems to be some workarounds.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** It seems like the data you're getting has their flair set to "None", which is a bit odd and seems like it'd get in the way of your analysis, since you're relying on the flair data in order to categorize each post. Some mention of this would probably have been good, because as of now, it seems like the data you currently have might not be usable for your purposes.

- **One thing I learned:** I had heard of the Pushshift API, but I didn't know there was a package for it, so that was cool to learn. It's too bad that it's in such a buggy state, though.
