## [Analyzing Blame Shifting on AITA](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/AITA-Blame-Analysis)


### Wilson

- **One thing I like:** I think your idea is really interesting, and it'll be cool to see what the end result is! It sucks though that you're running into so many issues simply collecting your data, but at least there seems to be some workarounds.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** It seems like the data you're getting has their flair set to "None", which is a bit odd and seems like it'd get in the way of your analysis, since you're relying on the flair data in order to categorize each post. Some mention of this would probably have been good, because as of now, it seems like the data you currently have might not be usable for your purposes.

- **One thing I learned:** I had heard of the Pushshift API, but I didn't know there was a package for it, so that was cool to learn. It's too bad that it's in such a buggy state, though.


### varun

- **one thing i think is done well:** i love the project idea, i read it and i went "dang that's good"

- **one suggestion:** maybe consider the role comments have to play? not just the up/down numbers but what they're saying? not sure if you are using that already for validation

- **one thing i learned:** i didn't know the PMAW existed, definitely good to know since i am working with reddit data!

### Soobin

- **One thing I liked:**
    I liked how in detail you explained your steps. It was very easy to follow your process of thoughts.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:**
    I believe you can uppercase the column names using .upper() method with for list comprehension. This was the only quibble I had.

- **One thing I learned:**
    I also did not know that there is a package for Reddit scraping! So cool to learn.

### Sen

- Your topic is really fun and well-thought out. You also explain your thought process in a lot of detail in your progress report which I find helpful. I'm looking forward to seeing how your analysis comes together. 

- I think the passive versus active voice is a good linguistic construction to analyze, but I think others might be necessary too. Maybe you could compile a list of words that people might use when blaming/shifting the blame and see how frequently they occur in asshole vs non-asshole posts. 

- I learned a lot more about SpaCy from checking out your code. 

### Camryn 
- **One thing I like:** As others have said, you have a really unique project idea. I also really appreciated your notes/comments throughout your notebooks.

- **One potential avenue for improvement:** This is more of a picky thing, but maybe having a summary section at the end of each question, so the results of each are more obvious. Also, if you are having issues with the sentences, regex could potentially be used to clean up some of the sentences that are giving you trouble.

- **One thing I learned:** I learned how to use displacy(from spacy), which is a cool feature with really interesting output!
