# Mack's Guestbook

Welcome to my guest book! Thanks for visiting.

## My Project

My project title is "Movie Gender Dialogue Analysis." You can visit my project repo [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/Movie-Gender-Dialogue-Analysis).

## Guestbook Notes

I really like your idea for the project and I think it will be really cool to explore. I am really interested in seeing how you plan to fill in the gaps, which is mentioned in your project plan. Furthermore, I thought your Data Object Creation file was very easy to read, and I like that you showed the dataframes and data relating to the dataframes a lot so that a reader can see whats going on. Sometimes its really easy to forget to show details like that, so it was really appreciated that those numbers were there!

In terms of improvement, I think your repository could benefit from a lot more organization and explanation. On the front page of your repository, it doesn't say anything, so someone viewing it has to explore and figure out where to go on their own. It would be helpful to explain in the README what aspects of your repository are and where they are located!

One thing I learned is that the data that you are working with is very extensive and a lot of the dataframes have columns in common, which will be really cool to see it all come together for data analysis purposes.
