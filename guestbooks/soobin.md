# Project

I am working on TED talk transcript and its rating. I am trying to build a classifier that can predict the rating of the talk based on the transcript. I am planning to use the vocab level as a independent variable for my project, and my current hypothesis is that the easier the vocab level is in the transcript, the higher (or the more positive) the rating would be. Why? IDK, I am just a person who does not like jargons so I thought other people would be the same? lol. If any other hypothesis you think, please let me know down below.
