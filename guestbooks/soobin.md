# Project

I am working on TED talk transcript and its rating. I am trying to build a classifier that can predict the rating of the talk based on the transcript. I am planning to use the vocab level as a independent variable for my project, and my current hypothesis is that the lower the vocab level is in the transcript, the higher (or the more positive) the rating would be. Why? IDK, I am just a person who does not like jargons so I thought other people would be the same? lol. If any other hypothesis you think, please let me know down below.

# Notes

## Sen's Notes
Soobin, I think that you've chosen an interesting topic, and I'm curious to see what you find out. From checking out your code, I learned some new functions and methods.

Based on your summary and progress report it seems you are still trying to figure out a working hypothesis. I think there are a lot of different lexical or linguistic features of speeches/talks that could affect the popularity or engagement that it receives. Some that come to mind are the speaker's tone, interrogatives like rhetorical questions, personal language, and emotional langauge, so you could try investigating those. You could also take measurements of features such as TTR and average sentence length to see if viewers prefer talks with more simple straightforward language or more complexity.

## Mack's Notes

I like the various hypotheses you have about what you think you will find. A lot of them make sense and I am curious if your analysis will support the hypotheses or generate something unexpected.

1. It seems like you've spent a lot of time working with the data and you've look at it from several different angles. I think bringing in Kband data was a great idea.

2. I think your notebook could use a little more commentary to help the reader understand what you are doing at each step and why. You've done a lot of great work wrangling with the data, so some comments and text will help us follow along.

3. I did not know there were these data out there on TED talks.
