# Analysis of the *Index Diachronica* Guestbook!!

W. Biggs

An analysis of the *[Index Diachronica](https://chridd.nfshost.com/diachronica/)*, a reference index of historical sound changes from old or proto-languages to modern languages.

* One thing I think is done well
I really like that you explained what you are working on in such detail. It would have been impossible to understand your work without `data_parsing.ipynb` file. (still not sure if I understood well though.)

* One suggestion
One thing I can sort of recommend for the final analysis is that it might help grouping sounds by their place of articulation since sound changes happen frequently between similar place of articulation (or in the case of vowel, high/low, front/back). You mentioned that you are planning to find which sound change is the most frequent and which is less frequent, so this might help you to grasp the idea..? (I hope it help)

* One thing I learned
I don't even know what to say in this section cause I honestly do not know what is going on in your python script. It's just too difficult for me to comprehend each code.. Just amazed by your extensive work on this..

#### Response

Thank you! That suggestion was actually helpful, I'm doing something related to that now.

#### one thing i think is done well

i like that you used a python script for data parsing - i think its far more effective than jupyter for those types of use cases

#### one suggestion

not too much, good work

#### one thing i learned

i had no idea that this dataset existed. will definitely be looking into the Searchable Index Diachronica

#### Response

Thanks!

### Sen's comment

- Your explanations are really detailed and thorough, they do an excellent job walking through your code so that was really helpful (especially as someone without a computer science background).

- You are working with a lot of data and all sorts of variations and changes, but I think some visualizations would definitely go a long way, especially moving from the data parsing to analysis stage.

- I learned about the Index Diachronica, which seems like a pretty fascinating dataset. I also learned a lot from your Python scripts, since it's quite different than code I'm used to reading and writing on my own (so many new libraries, so many great functions!)

### Mack's comments
1. You've done fantastic work! Its clear that you have spent a lot of time with the data and analyzing it.

2. I think some guidance around IPA/sound production may be beneficial to help deepen the understanding of your work for those outside of linguistic circles.

3. There is so much going on in your code, I can learn a lot by reviewing your scripts and notebooks further.
