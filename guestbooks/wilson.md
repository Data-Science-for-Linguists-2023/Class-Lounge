* One thing I think is done well
I really like that you explained what you are working on in such detail. It would have been impossible to understand your work without `data_parsing.ipynb` file. (still not sure if I understood well though.)

* One suggestion
One thing I can sort of recommend for the final analysis is that it might help grouping sounds by their place of articulation since sound changes happen frequently between similar place of articulation (or in the case of vowel, high/low, front/back). You mentioned that you are planning to find which sound change is the most frequent and which is less frequent, so this might help you to grasp the idea..? (I hope it help)

* One thing I learned
I don't even know what to say in this section cause I honestly do not know what is going on in your python script. It's just too difficult for me to comprehend each code.. Just amazed by your extensive work on this..

#### one thing i think is done well

i like that you used a python script for data parsing - i think its far more effective than jupyter for those types of use cases

#### one suggestion

not too much, good work

#### one thing i learned

i had no idea that this dataset existed. will definitely be looking into the Searchable Index Diachronica
