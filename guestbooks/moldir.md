## Guestbook

Hi! This is Moldir's guestbook. Thanks for visiting and I look forward to your feedback.

## Project

I am working on a project titled 'Kazakh-Russian code-switching analysis,' which you can find [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/Kazakh-Russian-Code-Switching-Analysis). I am currently facing some difficulties with annotating the conversational data in text files, and I would really appreciate any suggestions you may have for easy-to-use annotation tools. Thank you for your help in advance!
