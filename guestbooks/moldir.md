## Guestbook

Hi! This is Moldir's guestbook. Thanks for visiting and I look forward to your feedback.

## Project

I am working on a project titled 'Kazakh-Russian code-switching analysis,' which you can find [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/Kazakh-Russian-Code-Switching-Analysis). I am currently facing some difficulties with annotating the conversational data in text files, and I would really appreciate any suggestions you may have for easy-to-use annotation tools. Thank you for your help in advance!

## Notes  

### Mack
I really like your topic! It seems very interesting and I am excited to see how it goes.

1. I thought the overall structure of your repo was very easy to follow and understand the goals of your project and what progress you have made thus far. Very good narrative to help me follow along with your code and your annotation plan.

2. This may be cumbersome to do for the entire project but maybe just for some examples provide English translations. I know it isn't the main focus of your project but it will help the English-speaking audience better understand your research.

3. I learned that Kazakh speakers code switch to Russian *within* words! I am familiar with inter- and intra-sentential switching but this is the first I've heard of intra-word code switch.

I think you have a lot of great work done so far! One thing I really liked is that your jupyter notebook for the datasets was really well formatted, which made it really easy to read and understand what is going on. For example, I really like that you included advantages/disadvantages, and included a spot in the notebook about your future work. 

One thing that I think you could improve on is organizing your repository. Having folders or having explanations of what something is and where it is would be super helpful instead of having it all in main part. I also agree with the feedback above that including someEnglish translations would be helpful!

I learned that Kazakh-Russian code switching is very common because most Kazakhs are bilingual!

1. This is a very impressive project! I particularly liked the summary you included at the bottom of your "Annotated Dataset" JNB as some of the code was a bit more advanced than I am used to deciphering, but that summary helped me better understand the key takeaways from your data exploration. Your process was incredibly thorough and you did a great job exploring a smaller data sample to really get a feel for the strucutre and content of your data before applying your methods to the full dataset.

2. I know you aren't able to share most of your data, but one suggestion I would give is (if possible) to include an example of an utterance with your codes attached. We can see your annotation scheme as well as the counts of different annotations in your JNB, so having an example to see how those codes are being interpreted and applied to an actual piece of text could help put those pieces together and further clarify your annotation process. 

3. Like Mack said, I learned that code switching can occur intra-word, which is something I hadn't heard of previously. It was especially interesting to learn that intra-word code switching can occur by attaching an affix of one language to a stem of another language, which is fascinating.
